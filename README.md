## Web interface for NEARswap smart-contract.

NEARswap is part of [NEAR-CLP](https://github.com/near-clp/contracts) - a set of protocols for decentralized finance. With a ground research and solid experience in smart-contract development we define our mission to provide common goods for NEAR DeFi.


## Quick Start


To run this project locally:

1. Prerequisites: Make sure you've installed Node.js â‰¥ 14 and Yarn >= 1.22
2. Install dependencies: `yarn install`
3. Run the local development server: `yarn start` (see `package.json` for a
   full list of `scripts` you can run with `yarn`)

Now you'll have a local development environment backed by the NEAR TestNet!

Go ahead and play with the app and the code. As you make code changes, the app will automatically reload.


## Develop

Every smart contract in NEAR has its [own associated account][NEAR accounts]. When you run `yarn start`, your smart contract gets deployed to the live NEAR TestNet with a throwaway account. When you're ready to make it permanent, here's how.


### Step 0: Install near-cli (optional)


[near-cli] is a command line interface (CLI) for interacting with the NEAR blockchain. It was installed to the local `node_modules` folder when you ran `yarn install`, but for best ergonomics you may want to install it globally:

    yarn install --global near-cli

Or, if you'd rather use the locally-installed version, you can prefix all `near` commands with `npx`

Ensure that it's installed with `near --version` (or `npx near --version`)


### Step 1: Create an account for the contract

Each account on NEAR can have at most one contract deployed to it. If you've already created an account such as `your-name.testnet`, you can deploy your contract to `nearswap-interface.your-name.testnet`. Assuming you've already created an account on [NEAR Wallet], here's how to create `nearswap-interface.your-name.testnet`:

1. Authorize NEAR CLI, following the commands it gives you:

      near login

2. Create a subaccount (replace `YOUR-NAME` below with your actual account name):

      near create-account nearswap-interface.YOUR-NAME.testnet --masterAccount YOUR-NAME.testnet


### Step 2: set contract name in code


Modify the line in `src/config.js` that sets the account name of the contract. Set it to the account id you used above.

    const CONTRACT_NAME = process.env.CONTRACT_NAME || 'nearswap-interface.YOUR-NAME.testnet'


### Step 3: deploy!

One command:

    yarn deploy

As you can see in `package.json`, this does two things:

1. builds & deploys smart contract to NEAR TestNet
2. builds & deploys frontend code to GitHub using [gh-pages]. This will only work if the project already has a repository set up on GitHub. Feel free to modify the `deploy` script in `package.json` to deploy elsewhere.
